slateConf
=========

This is the [slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) configuration files
of Jean-Luc Colombier. Slate is a really powerful window manager for
Mac OSX.

You can find documentation for js configuration on the
[wiki](https://github.com/jigish/slate/wiki/JavaScript-Configs) of
[slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) repository.

TODO
----

- Better focus is quite slow but I have no real ideas to significantly
  improve it.
- Some stability must be added to better focus. The aim is to favorize
  windows previously focused.
